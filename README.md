# Let's play with Brno data

Outline:

> Have you heard of the term Open Data? Did you know that Brno provides Open Data?
  Do you know how to access them, how to handle them? How to properly visualize data and draw conclusions?
  And actually... what is the use of it?

> Letâ€™s talk Open Data!

This site has been made for the purposes of the talk / presentation. The code is freely available and licensed under open license.
The sole purpose of this effort is to popularize Open Data, show the good and the bad about them and advertise usage of R, which in my opinion is quite underrated language with immense potential.

The whole site has been deployed using [netlify](https://app.netlify.com/) and is available on https://devconf-brno-data.netlify.com/.

This talk takes part on [DevConf.cz](https://devconf.info/en) 2019.
